## About

We are a bunch of students who recently released playtin.com - a mini game platfrom where everybody
can create and share html5 mini games in the browser without a necessary knowledge of coding.

# Our plan

For the github game off challenge we will create some funny mini games in the Playtin-style.
To accelerate the development of the games we will use the playtin game editor.

If you can't wait until the end of November, you can already play some mini games on playtin.com
or create your own one ;)

### What we have used so far:

* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* TAU.js :)
