## About

We are a bunch of students who recently released [Playtin](http://playtin.com/ "paint, create and share!") - a mini game platfrom where everybody
can create and share html5 mini games in the browser without a necessary knowledge of coding.

For the github-gameoff challenge, we have built a mini game for each theme in the Playtin style.

### Instructions

All games are played with mouse clicks. Each game then has it's own instructions. So if you don't know what to do
you better read the instructions ;)

## Making of

To accelerate the development of the games we used our self developed [Playtin](http://playtin.com/ "paint, create and share!") game editor.

![debug game](http://playtin-gameoff.herokuapp.com/images/debug_branch.png "editor")

If you want, you can try it out by yourself and [create your own](http://playtin.com/ "create your own!") mini game!

## What we have used:

* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* TAU.js :)
* Heroku for hosting
