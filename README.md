## About

We are a bunch of students who recently released playtin.com - a mini game platfrom where everybody
can create and share html5 mini games in the browser without a necessary knowledge of coding.

# Our plan

For the github game off challenge we will create some funny mini games in the Playtin-style.
To accelerate the development of the games we will use the playtin game editor.

### What we have used so far:

* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* TAU.js :)
